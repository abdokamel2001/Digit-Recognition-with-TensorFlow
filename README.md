# Digit-Recognition-with-TensorFlow

This TensorFlow-based project focuses on digit recognition using the MNIST dataset. It includes a Jupyter Notebook for model training and evaluation.

## Contents

- `Digit_Recognition.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook for model training and evaluation.
- `Data/`: Folder containing the dataset.
- `labels.json`: JSON file with label information.
- `mnist_model.h5`: Trained model file for digit recognition.

## Usage

1. Open the `Digit_Recognition.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook to work with the project.
2. The dataset is stored in the `data/` folder, and labels are available in `labels.json`.
3. `mnist_model.h5` contains a pre-trained model for recognizing digits. You can use it for making predictions on new digit images.
