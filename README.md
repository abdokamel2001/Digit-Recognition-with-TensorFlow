# Digit-Recognition-with-TensorFlow

This TensorFlow-based project focuses on digit recognition using the MNIST dataset. It includes a Jupyter Notebook for model training and evaluation.

## Contents

- `Digit_Recognition.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook for model training and evaluation.
- `Data/`: Folder containing the dataset.
- `labels.json`: JSON file with label information.
- `Digit_Recognition.zip`: Zip archive containing the dataset and JSON file.
- `mnist_model.h5`: Trained model file for digit recognition.

## Usage

1. Open the `Digit_Recognition.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook to work with the project.
2. The dataset is stored in the `Data/` folder, and labels are available in `labels.json`.
3. To access the full dataset, download and extract `Digit_Recognition.zip`.

## Performance Plots

- `accuracy.png`: The plot displays the model's accuracy during training.
- `loss.png`: The plot shows the model's loss over the training epochs.
